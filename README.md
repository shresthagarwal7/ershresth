### A CLI based Script tool to create CPP files for programming contests

In times of contests, one has to create a CPP file, type code in it, test the cases, find the errors etc. Some times, it'd be really hectic to create files and start. But how about a tool to generate a directory which has all the files you need?? ;)

#### CODEIt eases this problem by creating the directory which has all files in it

Note: C++ template is only added for now

**From 20/12/2020, @Arch2x will be taking over this repo as a part of collab project**
